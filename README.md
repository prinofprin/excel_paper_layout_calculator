# Paper Layout Calculator
Working in a printery, one of the most delaying processes I found was the layout planning process for cutting the paper. Every time the printery's required to cut paper to an unusual size, the person responsible for cutting the paper has to calculate the most efficient way to cut the paper, to get the most paper sheet out of it. The process can take from 3 to 10 minutes, depending on the complication of the layout. I think this layouting process can be automated by creating a layout calculator using the Excel VBA code, so I created this layout calculator.

Goal: Create a calculator to find the most efficient layout for cutting paper into smaller portions to speed up my printery cutting process or any complex paper cutting projects

## Example
Assuming that you have a 24x35 Inches paper you need to cut it into A4 size paper(8.25"x11.75"). You want to know how many A4 papers you will get and the layout for cutting, so you can cut it accurately. Let's use my layout calculator to find out like an example image below.
